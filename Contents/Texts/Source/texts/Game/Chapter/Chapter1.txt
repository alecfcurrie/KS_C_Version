So[Beat]this the village[,] boss?[A]

[MidLeft]
Aye[,] it fits the bill.[A]

[MidRight]
So[Beat]we just head in and[N]
and round up the slav-[A]


[MidLeft]
That won't be necessary[.][N]
I'll handle this one myself.[AN]
You fools can keep watch and make[N]
sure no one interrupts my fun![A]

[MidRight]
O-oh[,] right boss. Just don't[N]
cause too much ruckus in there -[AN]
we don't need that lordling who's been[N]
snooping around catching wind of us.[A]

[MidLeft]
Tell me[,] Glove[,] who's the[N]
brains of this outfit?[A]

[MidRight]
[Beat]You are.[A]

[MidLeft]
Correct[.] I am[.][N]
Not you.[A]

[MidRight]
[Beat][A]

[MidLeft]
Now[,] as I said -[...] stand guard[,][N]
and let me enjoy myself.[A]

[MidRight]
Right[,] boss[.][N]
We'll hold the line.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadGlove]
Pompous bastard[,] always hogging the glory.[AN]
You heard him boys[!] Stand watch[,] and[N]
keep your eyes sharp for that lordling![AN]
If anything gets in your way, cut it[N]
down before it has the chance to shout![A][X]

## Chapter1InitialConvo3
[MidRight][LoadWesley]
[MidLeft][LoadAudrey]
So[,] Wesley[,] it appears this [N]
area is the target of the slavers'[AN]
next attack after all.[A]

[MidRight]
Indeed[.] It seems they've entrenched[N]
themselves deep within the valley[.][AN]
What are your orders[,] Princess Audrey?[A]

[MidLeft]
Our reinforcements are still a few moments[N]
away[,] but if we wait any longer[,] their[AN]
main force could slip away.[AN]
It's best we engage the slavers now[N]
before they slip through our fingers.[A]

[MidRight]
With all due respect[,] your [N]
Highness[,] are you certain[?][AN]
You've trained for this[,][N]
but true combat -[A]

[MidLeft]
- is nothing like sparring with dummies[.][AN]
I know Wesley[,] and by the goddess[,][N]
Cordell never lets me forget it[.][AN]
But he believes I'm ready[,] and today[N]
seems as good a day as any to prove it.[AN]
Besides[,] I doubt my conscience will be[N]
too troubled[,] given the filth we're[AN]
dealing with.[A]

[MidRight]
I see your mind is set.[AN]
I've known you long enough to know[N]
there's no swaying you now.[AN]
Very well[,] let us give these[N]
slavers the justice they deserve![AN]
But remember[,] our reinforcements[N]
are not far behind.[AN]
Don't stray too far ahead![A]

[FarRight][LoadVillager2]
Elder[!] A lone[N]
visitor has arrived![A]

[Right][LoadVillager1]
Hail[,] traveller[.] What business[N]
brings you to Gorien?[A]

[MidLeft]
The name's Fester[.] I'm but a[N]
humble[Beat]merchant[,] of sorts.[AN]
I've come to your village in the hopes[N]
of procuring some goods for my trade.[A]

[Right]
You'll find little here worth trading[.][AN]
Our harvest is meagre[,] and[N]
the seasons have not been kind.[A]

[MidLeft]
Oh[,] I'm not after crops or trinkets[.][N]
My interests lie elsewhere.[AN]
I've heard whispers that you're[N]
sheltering Felean refugees.[A]

[Right][MoveMidRight]
You[Beat]you're a slaver![A]

[MidLeft]
I prefer "merchant[,]" but let's[N]
not split hairs[.][AN]
I'd rather conduct our business[N]
without any[Beat]unpleasantness.[A]

[FarRight]
Should I call the militia?[A]

[MidRight]
[Beat][A]

[MidLeft]
Since I'm feeling generous today[,][N]
I'll make it simple for you.[AN]
Hand over the Felean refugees in[N]
exchange for the safety of your village.[AN]
Not a single home need be touched[,][N]
not a single life need be lost.[AN]
A fair trade, don't you think?[A]

[MidRight][MoveRight]
[Beat]Don't summon the militia.[A]

[MidLeft]
Oh[?] I expected[N]
more resistance.[A]


[Right]
Gather the children - the ones who[N]
arrived a fortnight ago.[AN]
I won't gamble the lives of my people[N]
for the sake of a few refugees.[A]

[FarRight]
A-as you wish[,] elder.[A]
[ClearFace]

[MidLeft]
A wise choice[,] elder[.] I just knew[N]
we could come to an agreement![A][X]

## Chapter1Turn2PP1

[MidRight][LoadWesley]
[MidLeft][LoadAudrey]
What was that sound?[A]

[MidRight]
It sounded like a tree falling.[AN]
Perhaps the enemy is cutting down thickets[N]
to cross the river and outflank us.[A]

[Left]
I thought this was a[N]
small slaver band[!][AN]
How do they have the men to[N]
coordinate such a manoeuvre?[A]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

[FarFarLeft]
Lady Audrey, I expected you to[N]
remember the first rule of tactics[:][AN]
Never underestimate your foe.[A][X]

[Left][LoadOsborne]
[MidRight][LoadAudrey]
Osborne[!] Elaine[!] I'm[N]
relieved you've caught up![A]

[Left]
As am I[,] milady[,] though I must[N]
say[,] the plan we agreed upon[AN]
has[Beat]unraveled somewhat.[N]
Did I not counsel patience[,][AN]
to wait until our forces were[N]
fully assembled before striking?[A]


[MidRight]
Yes[,] but once we arrived[,] the[N]
slavers had already established[AN]
themselves in the valley.[N]
I thought it best to act swiftly[,][AN]
rather than risk letting them[N]
slip through our grasp.[A]

[Left]
Hmm[,] understandable[Beat]but[N]
a dangerous play[.][AN]
I doubt King Leland would be pleased[N]
to hear his daughter gambled her safety[AN]
on her very first day of battle.[A]

[FarLeft]
She knew reinforcements were coming[,] so[N]
let's not dwell on it[!][AN]
What matters now is that[N]
we've got her back![A]

[MidRight]
Well said[,] Elaine! Now let's rid[N]
this valley of the slaver scourge![A]

[FarLeft]
Right behind you[,] milady![A]
[ClearFace]

[MidRight]
[ClearFace]

[Left]
[CloseEyes]Oh[,] what reckless[N]
courage youth have.[A][X]

## Chapter1Turn2EP1
[MidLeft][LoadGlove]
[Right][LoadFester]
That went well[!][AN]
The villagers didn't so much as blink[N]
while I went about my business![A]

[MidLeft]
Looks like you've caught [N]
some fresh meat![A]

[Right]
Quite so[.] Well then[,] care to[N]
introduce yourselves[,] boys?[A]

[FarRight][LoadJyri]
[Beat][A]
[ClearFace]

[FarRight][LoadLiev]
[Beat][A]
[ClearFace]

[Right]
Ah[,] no matter[.] I don't need[N]
them to speak to sell them![A]

[MidLeft]
Heh[,] true enough.[AN]
Now that you're here[,] though[,][N]
I heard trees coming down.[AN]
Some of our boys might be[N]
tangling with that lordling.[A]

[Right]
And this concerns me[N]
how[,] exactly?[A]

[MidLeft]
Aren't you going to help?[A]

[Right]
Oh[,] Glove[,] your memory fails you![AN]
My task was to gather slaves from[N]
the village - at any cost.[AN]
Your task is to keep me[N]
safe at all costs[.][AN]
So[,] naturally[,] I must return[N]
to base with my prize.[AN]
You[,] however[,] should be dealing[N]
with that lordling and her knights[.][AN]
Try to keep them off my back![A]

[MidLeft]
O-oh.[A]

[Right]
What's the problem[?] You've got[N]
near twenty men at your command.[AN]
One simple lordling and a handful[N]
of knights shouldn't trouble you.[AN]
Honestly[,] Glove[,] have a little[N]
more confidence.[A]

[MidLeft]
R-right[.] Well[,]  I'll see you[N]
back at the base[,] then.[A]

[Right]
That's more like it[.][N]
Farewell[,] Glove![A]

He's even more of a fool than I thought.[N]
I can't believe he actually fell for[AN]
the idea that I was ordered to leave[N]
him behind. Wouldn't you two agree?[A]

[Left]
[Beat][A]

[FarLeft]
[Beat][A]

[MidRight]
Pah[,] no matter.[AN]
I've no intention of sticking[N]
around to face Cordell's knights.[AN]
Let's hope Glove can at least[N]
keep them off my trail.[AN]
Come now[,] boys! You're worth[N]
more whole than in pieces.[AN]
Don't make me lose my temper![A][X]

already gotten a head start.[A]

[MidRight]
Cordell[!] Surge[!][N]
It's good to see the both of you[.][AN]
We were concerned the slavers [N]
weren't going to stick around[,] so -[A]

[FarLeft]
Princess[,] don't bother explaining it[.][AN]
Just point me towards which bandits'[N]
skulls I need to crack.[A]

[Left]
Indeed[,] let us focus on the battle[.][AN]
We must move quickly to stamp out[N]
this blight before they get away![A][X]

## Chapter1Turn3EP

[MidRight][LoadVillager1]
[MidLeft][LoadOsma]
Elder[!] What was that[N]
commotion just now[?][AN]
I saw people moving[N]
about in a panic.[A]

[MidRight]
O-Oh[,] Osma[Beat]It's[N]
nothing that concerns you.[A]

[MidLeft]
What happened to the refugees[?][N]
Where are the Felean children?[A]

[MidRight]
A man came to our village[.][N]
He threatened to burn down everything[N]
if we didn't hand the children over.[AN]
I-I did what I had to[.][A]

[MidLeft]
You gave them to him?[!][N]
We have a militia[,] Elder[!][AN]
We could've fought back![A]

[MidRight]
And risk what[?] My duty is to[N]
protect this village[,] Osma.[AN]
What if that man had followed[N]
through with his threat?[AN]
What if our people had died[N]
trying to shield a few outsiders?[A]

[MidLeft]
Two of our own are as[N]
good as dead already![AN]
By giving them to that slaver,[N]
you've condemned those children[AN]
to a fate worse than death![A]

[MidRight]
Those children were NOT [N]
of this village[!][AN]
They were wanderers[,] living[N]
off what little we could spare.[AN]
We could not afford to protect[N]
them at the cost of our lives![A]

[MidLeft]
How can you be so heartless[?][N]
They were children[,] Elder![A]

[MidRight]
Enough[,] Osma[!][N]
I will not tolerate insubordination.[AN]
You are forbidden from engaging[N]
with those bandits.[AN]
We cannot endanger the prosperity[N]
of our village over mere sentiment![A]
[ClearFace]

[MidLeft]
Heartless old fool[Beat]I can't[N]
stand by and let this happen.[AN]
But if I act too soon[,][N]
I'll put everyone at risk.[AN]
I'll have to bide my time[Beat][N]
wait until the right moment.[AN]
When he's not breathing down my[N]
neck[,] I'll find a way to rescue them.[A][X]

That seems to be the last of them.[A]

## Chapter1EndingConvo2

[FarLeft][LoadCordell]
[Left][LoadAudrey]
The village is[Beat]untouched.[A]

[FarLeft]
It appears so[.][AN]
There's no sign of any[N]
attack or plunder.[A]

[Right][LoadOsborne]
Something feels amiss[.][N]
We should speak with the villagers.[A]

[FarRight][LoadVillager1]
Sir Cordell[!] I thank you[N]
for coming to our rescue![A]

[FarLeft]
It's my duty to help.[AN]
I only wish that I could[N]
have arrived here sooner.[AN]
Pray tell[,] are there any[N]
injured?[A]

[FarRight]
None[,] Sir Cordell.[AN]
A lone bandit entered town a moment[N]
ago demanding that all Felean[N]
refugees be immediately handed over.[AN]
We complied to avoid bloodshed.[A]

[Left]
You complied?![A]

[FarRight]
P-princess Audrey?![A]

[Left]
This village has a militia[!][N]
Did you not even try to resist?[A]

[Right]
Lady Audrey[,] I implore you to[N]
calm down and let the man speak.[A]

[FarRight]
Th-there were only two children -[....][N]
orphans who arrived weeks ago[.][AN]
I do not know who was caring[N]
for them or why[,] but I can't[AN]
risk the security of the entire[N]
village over two vagabonds.[A]

[Left]
[MoveLeft]
Vagabonds[?] Those were[N]
children[!] How could you -[A]

Control yourself![A]

My apologies for Lady Audrey's[N]

It is her first time on[N]

Can you tell us where the[N]

[FarRight]
I do not know[,] Sir Cordell[.][AN]

O-of course[,] Sir Cordell[.][N]

How did it go in there?[A]

[Left]
It's[Beat]disgraceful.[AN]
They just let the slavers take the[N]
children[,] as if they were nothing![A]

[FarRight]
O-oh[Beat][N]
That's terrible.[A]

[Left]
I knew some resented my father's[N]
decision to shelter the refugees[,][AN]
but to stand by and let children[N]
be kidnapped[Beat][A]

[FarLeft]
I must admit I did not expect the dissent[N]
of the villagers to be so extreme.[AN]
However[,] Lady Audrey[,] you must not[N]
let your emotions get the better of you.[A]

[Left][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadAudrey]
How can I NOT let my emotions[N]
get the better of me?[AN]
They stood by while those[N]
children were taken[,] Osborne![A]

[FarLeft]
I share your outrage[,] Lady Audrey[,] but[N]
anger will not bring those children back.[AN]
We need cooperation[,] not scorn[,] if we[N]
are to uncover useful information.[A]

[Right]
What does it matter[?] That coward[N]
had nothing useful to offer.[A]

[LoadOverworldFaces]

[FarFarLeft]
I might be able to[N]
help with that.[A][X]

## Chapter1EndingConvo4
[FarLeft][LoadOsma]
[Right][LoadAudrey]
[FarRight][LoadCordell]
Who are you?[A]

[FarLeft]
My name is Osma.[AN]
The two children those bandits kidnapped[N]
arrived in our village a fortnight ago.[AN]
They stated they were part of a merchant[N]
convoy that got raided, and had been[AN]
wandering the countryside for many days.[AN]
After hearing their tale[,] I [N]
offered to care for them[.][AN]
However[,] many of the other villagers[N]
despised the Felean refugees.[AN]
I imagine most of them were all too happy[N]
to see them go.[A]

[Right]
That's awful![A]

[FarLeft]
Indeed[.] I wasn't able to stop them[N]
in time[,] but I saw the bandits flee.[AN]
They went north[,] toward[N]
Chariot Valley.[A]


[Left][LoadOsborne]
I see[.] You have our thanks[,] Osma[.][N]
We'll follow their trail at once.[A]

[FarLeft]
Please[,] allow me to join you[.][AN]
I'm a trained anima mage[,] so[AN]
you needn't worry about keeping[N]
me safe all the time.[AN]
Plus[,] I have a score to settle with[N]
these slaver scumbags.[A]

[Left]
Well[,] we've clearly underestimated[N]
the size of this slaver operation.[AN]
A capable mage would be a valuable[N]
asset[.] What say you[,] Cordell?[A]

[FarRight]
I have no objections[.][N]
Welcome to the team[,] Osma.[A]

[Right]
Yes[,] welcome[!][AN]
And don't worry - I won't rest[N]
until those children are safe.[A]

[FarLeft]
Thank you very much[!][N]
I won't let you down![A]

[Left]
We haven't a moment to lose. Let's[N]
move north before the trail grows cold.[A][X]
